# DEPRECATED!! Please use the [JsDoc Webpack Plugin](https://github.com/tfiwm/jsdoc-webpack-plugin) instead of the loader.
# JsDoc loader for [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)

## Install

`npm install jsdoc-loader webpack --save-dev`

---

## Usage

[Documentation: Using loaders](http://webpack.github.io/docs/using-loaders.html)

The loader takes the jsdoc.conf file from the working directory.
